# certabo-lichess
Standalone, headless software to link Certabo chessboards with Lichess.

## Synopsis
This software allows you to play any game on Lichess with your Certabo (https://www.certabo.com/) digital chessboard. The software is headless and does not require additional drivers or libs. It is best deployed on a minicomputer like a Raspberry Pi, so the board can be hooked up in this fashion:


When powered on with this software running, the board will automatically snap into your "foreground" game on Lichess. You can also pick up games that are already running. It is also possible to intermittendly make moves on another device, or continue a game elsewhere. If you power the board while no game is running, the software will wait until one has started. Similarly, when all games have ended, it will wait for a new one to start.
